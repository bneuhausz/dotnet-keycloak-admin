A basic .NET 8 API to poke around Keycloak admin API and role based authorization.

Aiming to have more or less the same functionality as https://github.com/bneuhausz/angular-keycloak-admin but obviously in a more secure environment.

Might build out https://github.com/bneuhausz/angular-keycloak a bit more on top of this repo later.

Docker compose setup for development:
